# FaceOff
This is an attempt to recreate Michael Zolloeffer's work from Part I of his paper Zollhöfer, M. 2015, 'Real-Time Reconstruction of Static and Dynamic Scenes', pp. 1–196.

The paper describes a method for constructing personal avatars from Kinect RGB-D scans using a 3D Morphable Face Model
It's also an attempt by me to get to grips with some fundamental CV toolkits including OpenCV and PCL
